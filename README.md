# DailyUI Challenge

Trying to step up my design game by practicing the art a little more. Will be designing one item every day for 100 days straight, and uploading them here. Please feel free to leave feedback on Dribbble. 

#### Day 1 - Sign Up

Designed a simple modal sign up sheet for use on the web. Not completely happy with the result, but limited myself to < 1hr. Hopefully I'll get better over time, and this will stand to show the progress I've made.
