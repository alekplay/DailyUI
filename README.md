# DailyUI Challenge

Trying to step up my design game by practicing the art a little more. Will be designing one item every day for 100 days straight, and uploading them here. Please feel free to leave feedback on Dribbble. 

#### Day 16 - PopUp/ Overlay

Not too fond of these open ended challenges, as I end up spending more time figuring out what to make than actually making something.

However after browsing Dribbble for a while, I had enough inspiration to look at to make this.

#### Day 15 - On/ Off Switch

Kept it simple this time, couldn't come up with any original ideas so basically just redesigned the iOS switch.

#### Day 14 - Countdown Timer

Second animation! Seeing how many other countdown timers on Dribbble were animated, I felt I had to throw one together as well.

I cheated a little by using interface elements from my parking app, but all the animations were made from scratch. Rather happy how they turned out, especially the one going from the countdown back to the main screen.

#### Day 13 - Direct Messaging

This didn't turn out as good as I had envisioned, but I think if I gave myself a little more time I could've come up with something better. Maybe another time.

#### Day 12 - E Commerce Shop Single Item

Had to quickly throw something together for this one, was a little tight on time. Got inspired by another similar shot, but it didn't turn out as good as I had hoped. 

Still not too bad though I think.

#### Day 11 - Flash Message Error/ Success

Kept it simple today, just two small popups for a generic error/ success.

#### Day 10 - Social Share

Today was the first day I decided to submit an animation for my challenge. Quickly mocked up two screens in Sketch, then used Principle to animate between them.

Both the .sketch and the .principle file is uploaded to GitHub.

#### Day 9 - Music Player

Couldn't really think of anything too original, so mixed a lot of concepts I found while browsing similar shots on Dribbble.

#### Day 8 - 404 Page

Designed two screens for this challenge. One a little more serious, where I tried to help the customer who reached the 404-screen in the best possible way. 

The other was more just for fun.

#### Day 7 - Settings

Didn't have much of a plan or a purpose for this one, so ended up being a mix of a bunch of random thoughts. 

Overall not too shabby, but I can see several optimizations that could've made it better. Furthermore, I think it would've been even better if it had a purpose.

#### Day 6 - User Profile

Again, time constraints got the better of me. I had some really exciting ideas for this one, but I had to throw together something last minute and therefore I went with something a bit more safe and easy.

It turned out rather good, but in my opinion very plain and boring. Hoping that I'll be able to be more creative with some of the other challenges in the future.

#### Day 5 - App Icon

I have never been much of an illustrator, and that's not why I went into this challenge at all. However it's a good exercise, and a nice skill to have. So I decided to go with it, and make whatever I could think of.

After randomly playing around with simple shapes in Sketch, I ended up with what resembled a moon. From there I decided to make the app icon for a moon phase tracking app, and that's how today's challenge design was born.

#### Day 4 - Calculator

Probably one of my favorite designs so far. Today's challenge was to make a calculator, and since I have long been wanting to design a macOS app I decided to go with a desktop calculator. 

However I quickly realized pressing numbers on the screen with your mouse is highly inefficient, and most users would probably prefer to input their queries by typing. 

Therefore I designed a simple Wolfram Alpha style calculator that should be able to do pretty much anything you want.

#### Day 3 - Landing Page

Due to time constraints, I only had about 10 minutes or so to throw together this design. Accompanied by the fact that I had no idea what product to promote on said landing page, it didn't turn out too well.

I managed to throw together a purchase page for paper from the fictional paper company "Dunder Mifflin", but I am in no way satisfied with this design.

Eh, you can't win them all.

#### Day 2 - Credit Card Checkout

Designed a simple, yet heavy, Adidas style checkout form for a shoe. Spent a little over my 1 hour limit, but mainly due to editing the product photo itself.

Overall I'm rather happy with how this turned out, though looking back I see several improvements that I could've done. 

Firstly there is no context to the design itself, a back button or something indicating your process through the purchase would be nice. Furthermore, the sidebar could've been a lot nicer though I don't have any direct ideas on how to do so. Spacing could also have been improved, as it feels a little cramed at the moment.

#### Day 1 - Sign Up

Designed a simple modal sign up sheet for use on the web. Not completely happy with the result, but limited myself to < 1hr. Hopefully I'll get better over time, and this will stand to show the progress I've made.
